DirtyBomb to hide you in the web
It is impossible too hide completly in the web. You will always leave some traces and sometimes it is nearly impossible too dodge google products. Therefore this projects will not hide you by reducing your traces, but rather by leaving many many other traces.
Hopefully google cam not to see the wood for the trees 
The Projects hides you from google by sending out faked youtube searches and google searches and random time periods.
Clicks on a random amount of google searches.
Works currently only on my pc.
Twitter is in work.
Clicking on youtube videos is planned.
Aswell as looking into making everything, espacially the outgoing sites from google more trackable.
While most websites clicked on, but wikipedia, will probably have tracking too, i do not think that google notices that a link is clicked on at the moment
